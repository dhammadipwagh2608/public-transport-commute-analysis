# Public Transport Commute Pattern Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing public transport commute patterns to understand
how different transport modes, peak hours, and passenger types impact commute duration.
The objective is to derive clear insights from structured data and present them
through a simple and interactive dashboard.

## Dataset
The dataset contains simulated public transport commute records with the following attributes:
- City and route information
- Transport mode (Bus, Metro, Auto)
- Commute distance and duration
- Peak hour indicator
- Ticket and passenger type

The dataset is stored in the `data/` folder and is used for both analysis and visualization.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded and explored commute data using Python.
2. Cleaned and formatted date and time fields.
3. Analyzed commute duration across cities, transport modes, and peak hours.
4. Identified patterns related to peak-hour congestion and transport efficiency.
5. Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize key commute trends.

## Key Insights
- Commute duration is significantly higher during peak hours across all transport modes.
- Metro routes show more consistent commute times compared to buses during peak hours.
- Bus commutes vary more based on route and city.
- Students and working professionals experience different commute patterns based on time of day.

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard presents:
- Commute duration by transport mode
- Peak vs non-peak hour comparison
- City-wise commute trends
- Route-level insights using slicers

A preview of the dashboard is available in the `images/` folder.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how structured data analysis combined with dashboards
can help understand urban mobility patterns and support data-driven decision-making.
The focus of the project is clarity, analysis, and effective communication of insights.
